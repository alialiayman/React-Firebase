This GitHub repository showcases my knowledge and expertise in using React, Firebase, and other related technologies to build powerful web applications. The project uses the latest version of React, along with the Redux Toolkit for managing the state of the application. Material UI is used for creating beautiful and responsive user interfaces, while Firebase provides the backend infrastructure for data storage, authentication, and other features. The project also includes integration with React Router for client-side routing and analytics tools, allowing for detailed tracking and reporting of user behavior. Additionally, the project demonstrates my ability to deploy to multiple sites, as well as to preview channels in pull requests. The project also uses Videojs, Calendly, and Mux for providing advanced multimedia and scheduling functionality. Overall, this repository serves as a comprehensive demonstration of my skills in React and Firebase development.
